  "body": "### Purpose\r\nThis guide will show you how to get started using the [web API](www.eia.gov/opendata) provided by the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](www.eia.gov) to access interesting data and statistics.  This API provides access to all kinds of interesting data related to energy usage in the U.S.  For example, you can access data on electricity consumption and pricing, use of natural resources like oil, coal and natural gas, and the energy outlook on both a short and long-term basis you can even get hourly updates on the day-ahead demand forecast for electricity usage.  Much of this data is available on a regional level or nationwide.  There is even a large set of data related to international energy usage. \r\n\r\nThere is so much data available and types of queries you can make that it may seem overwhelming.  To narrow the scope down a bit for the purpose of showing you how to use this huge database and get what you want out of it, we'll be focusing specifically on nuclear power generation in the U.S.  \r\n\r\n### Obtaining an API Key\r\nGetting an API key is the first step to interacting with the EIA database.  Don't worry, it's free!  You will include this key in the URL query string when making requests to the site.  To get your key, first you need to go register at the EIA website.  The purpose of this registering and getting the key is so that the EIA can notify you of any changes to the API.  They don't state it on their website, but they might also use it to throttle your usage in case you are making an excessive number of requests.\r\n\r\nSo [go here now](www.eia.gov/opendata/register.cfm) to get registered and receive your key!  Here is what the registration form looks like:\r\n\r\n![registration](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/register.png)\r\n\r\nEnter your e-mail, agree to the terms and click \"register.\"  Then check your e-mail and you should have received something like this:\r\n\r\n![API Key E-mail](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/api_key.png)\r\n\r\nThat long alpha-numeric string (I've partially blacked out a portion of mine) is your API key.\r\n\r\n### API Documentation\r\n\r\nThe EIA's [API documentation](www.eia.gov/opendata/commands.cfm) does not provide a great description of the different types of queries that can be made.  If you visit the documentation page you will see terms like \"Series Query\", \"Geoset Query\" and \"Relation Query\" accompanied with a lot of technical jargon.  **We are going to ignore all of this for now.**  For someone just getting started, I would recommend a different approach.  \r\n\r\nThe important thing to know for now is that most of the queries that are performed return a time series of data.  Think of a two-column table with the first column being a series of dates and the next column being the value we are interested in.  For example, we could request the yearly percentage of electricity generation that comes from nuclear power plants.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started -- Your First API Call\r\n\r\nBut before we jump straight into getting some real data, let's first try a simple API call to see how it works.  So how do we do that?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the EIA provides a neat tool called the API Browser.  Go to the [API Browser page](http://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.cfm).  Here you will see a list of the different data sets available.  \r\n\r\n![API Browser](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/api_browser.png)\r\n\r\nThink of this like the top level in a big data hierarchy.  Each of the \"children categories\" is a link to a group of related data.  This is the best way to navigate the API and find what you're looking for.  The coolest part is that it shows you right on the page how to make the API call to what you're currently looking at.  So let's do that.  Let's make a call to this page and see if we can receive a JSON object giving us each of these top-level categories.  Write and execute the following javascript code in your web browser or a tool like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).  We're just going to output stuff to the console; so open the console on your browser to see the response.  Remember to replace my api_key with yours!  \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar req = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\nvar api_key = \"api_key=45AF21865123456789FD6F039FC9AB94\";\r\nvar url = \"http://api.eia.gov/category/?\";\r\nvar query = \"&category_id=371\";\r\n\r\nreq.open(\"GET\", url + api_key + query, true);\r\nreq.addEventListener('load', function(){\r\n    var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);\r\n    console.log(response);\r\n});\r\nreq.send(null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we run the above code and examine the output in the console, we can see that we received a JSON object with the name \"EIA Data Sets\" and that there is an object corresponding to each of the children categories.\r\n\r\n![Category Response](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/cat_resp.png)\r\n\r\nOk, that was a good first example.  In the next few API calls, we'll mainly just be changing these two lines of the previous code block to match the query string for the data we're trying to access:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar url = \"http://api.eia.gov/category/?\";\r\nvar query = \"&category_id=371\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting Some Real Data\r\n\r\nSo let's walk through how we might request how much of the nation's electricity production came from nuclear power plants.  We're going to use the API browser again, but this time drill way down through several categories and sub-categories.  Navigate to the following path using the category links in the API browser:  `EIA Data Sets > Total Energy > Nuclear Energy > Nuclear Energy Overview`.  Here is what you should see:\r\n\r\n![Nuclear Energy Overview](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_nrg_over.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point we've drilled down several categories, but have not yet reached any data.  The API browser conveniently provides us with another API call URL that will access the data on this page; but like the previous example, this would only give us the list of objects shown on this page.  However, each of these links is actual data.  How do I know that?  Because the bullet list is denoted \"Child Series\", whereas on previous pages we were looking at list of \"Children Categories\".  That is how you know whether you are looking at another sub-category or actual data.  So click the link to \"Nuclear Share of Electricity Net Generation, Annual (Percent)\" and you will be taken to the following page:\r\n\r\n![Nuclear Energy Overview](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_share.png)\r\n\r\nExcellent!  Exactly what we wanted.  We can see on this page a nice plot showing the percentage of U.S. electricity that came from nuclear power on an annual basis.  Now to get this data using the API, all we have to do is use the query string given to us on this page.  Let's modify our code and see if we can get a JSON object containing this data.  All we have to do is change our query variable, right?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar query = \"&series_id=TOTAL.NUETSUS.A\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nOops!  That didn't work.  Can you figure out why?  We have to change our URL as well since we are now querying a series instead of categories.  So let's create a new variable called `type` that we can change depending on which the kind of data we are requesting.  Here's what the entire request code looks like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar req = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\nvar url = \"http://api.eia.gov/\";\r\nvar type = \"series/?\";\r\nvar api_key = \"api_key=45AF218653356B8673FD6F039FC9AB94\";\r\nvar query = \"&series_id=TOTAL.NUETSUS.A\";\r\nreq.open(\"GET\", url + type + api_key + query, true);\r\nreq.addEventListener('load', function() {\r\n    var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);\r\n    console.log(response);\r\n});\r\nreq.send(null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamining the output in the console, we see that nested in the response object is an array of data which is the same as what was shown on the API browser page.  \r\n\r\n![Nuclear Energy Overview](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_share_output.png)\r\n\r\nThere is an array of objects each containing a year and a percentage value (e.g. 2013 and 19.4).  The value is the percentage of electricity that came from nuclear power.",
