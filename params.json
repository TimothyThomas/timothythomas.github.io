  "body": "### Purpose\r\nThis guide will show you how to get started using the web API provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration to access interesting data and statistics.\r\nYou \r\n### Obtaining an API Key\r\nGetting an API key is the first step to interacting with the EIA database.  You will include this key in the URL query string when making requests to the site.  To get your key, first you need to go register at the EIA website.  The purpose of this registering and getting the key is so that the EIA can notify you of any changes to the API.  They don't state it on their website, but they might also use it to throttle your usage in case you are making too many requests in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nSo [go here now](www.eia.gov/opendata/register.cfm) to get registered and receive your key!  Here is what the registration form looks like.  \r\n\r\n![registration](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/register.png)\r\n\r\nEnter your e-mail, agree to the terms and click \"register.\"  Then check your e-mail and you should have received something like the following:\r\n\r\n![API Key E-mail](https://timothythomas.github.io/images/api_key.png)\r\n",
