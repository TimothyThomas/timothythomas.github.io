<a id="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h3>

<p>This guide will show you how to get started using the <a href="www.eia.gov/opendata">web API</a> provided by the <a href="www.eia.gov">U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> to access interesting data and statistics.  This API provides access to all kinds of interesting data related to energy usage in the U.S.  For example, you can access data on electricity consumption and pricing, use of natural resources like oil, coal and natural gas, and the energy outlook on both a short and long-term basis you can even get hourly updates on the day-ahead demand forecast for electricity usage.  Much of this data is available on a regional level or nationwide.  There is even a large set of data related to international energy usage. </p>

<p>There is so much data available and types of queries you can make that it may seem overwhelming.  To narrow the scope down a bit for the purpose of showing you how to use this huge database and get what you want out of it, we'll be focusing specifically on nuclear power generation in the U.S.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="obtaining-an-api-key" class="anchor" href="#obtaining-an-api-key" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obtaining an API Key</h3>

<p>Getting an API key is the first step to interacting with the EIA database.  Don't worry, it's free!  You will include this key in the URL query string when making requests to the site.  To get your key, first you need to go register at the EIA website.  The purpose of this registering and getting the key is so that the EIA can notify you of any changes to the API.  They don't state it on their website, but they might also use it to throttle your usage in case you are making an excessive number of requests.</p>

<p>So <a href="www.eia.gov/opendata/register.cfm">go here now</a> to get registered and receive your key!  Here is what the registration form looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/register.png" alt="registration"></p>

<p>Enter your e-mail, agree to the terms and click "register."  Then check your e-mail and you should have received something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/api_key.png" alt="API Key E-mail"></p>

<p>That long alpha-numeric string (I've partially blacked out a portion of mine) is your API key.</p>

<h3>
<a id="api-documentation" class="anchor" href="#api-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API Documentation</h3>

<p>The EIA's <a href="www.eia.gov/opendata/commands.cfm">API documentation</a> does not provide a great description of the different types of queries that can be made.  If you visit the documentation page you will see terms like "Series Query", "Geoset Query" and "Relation Query" accompanied with a lot of technical jargon.  <strong>We are going to ignore all of this for now.</strong>  For someone just getting started, I would recommend a different approach.  </p>

<p>The important thing to know for now is that most of the queries that are performed return a time series of data.  Think of a two-column table with the first column being a series of dates and the next column being the value we are interested in.  For example, we could request the yearly percentage of electricity generation that comes from nuclear power plants.</p>

<h3>
<a id="your-first-api-call" class="anchor" href="#your-first-api-call" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your First API Call</h3>

<p>But before we jump straight into getting some real data, let's first try a simple API call to see how it works.  So how do we do that?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the EIA provides a neat tool called the API Browser.  Go to the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.cfm">API Browser page</a>.  Here you will see a list of the different data sets available.  </p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/api_browser.png" alt="API Browser"></p>

<p>Think of this like the top level in a big data hierarchy.  Each of the "children categories" is a link to a group of related data.  This is the best way to navigate the API and find what you're looking for.  The coolest part is that it shows you right on the page how to make the API call to what you're currently looking at.  So let's do that.  Let's make a call to this page and see if we can receive a JSON object giving us each of these top-level categories.  Write and execute the following javascript code in your web browser or a tool like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>.  We're just going to output stuff to the console; so open the console on your browser to see the response.  Remember to replace my api_key with yours!  </p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> req <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-k">new</span> <span class="pl-en">XMLHttpRequest</span>();
<span class="pl-k">var</span> api_key <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>api_key=45AF21865123456789FD6F039FC9AB94<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> url <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>http://api.eia.gov/category/?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> query <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&amp;category_id=371<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;

<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-c1">open</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>GET<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, url <span class="pl-k">+</span> api_key <span class="pl-k">+</span> query, <span class="pl-c1">true</span>);
<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-en">addEventListener</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>load<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>, <span class="pl-k">function</span>(){
    <span class="pl-k">var</span> response <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">JSON</span>.<span class="pl-c1">parse</span>(<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-smi">responseText</span>);
    <span class="pl-en">console</span>.<span class="pl-c1">log</span>(response);
});
<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-c1">send</span>(<span class="pl-c1">null</span>);</pre></div>

<p>If we run the above code and examine the output in the console, we can see that we received a JSON object with the name "EIA Data Sets" and that there is an object corresponding to each of the children categories.</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/cat_resp.png" alt="Category Response"></p>

<p>Ok, that was a good first example.  In the next few API calls, we'll mainly just be changing these two lines of the previous code block to match the query string for the data we're trying to access:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> url <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>http://api.eia.gov/category/?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> query <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&amp;category_id=371<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;</pre></div>

<h3>
<a id="getting-some-real-data" class="anchor" href="#getting-some-real-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Some Real Data</h3>

<p>So let's walk through how we might request how much of the nation's electricity production came from nuclear power plants.  We're going to use the API browser again, but this time drill way down through several categories and sub-categories.  Navigate to the following path using the category links in the API browser:  <code>EIA Data Sets &gt; Total Energy &gt; Nuclear Energy &gt; Nuclear Energy Overview</code>.  Here is what you should see:</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_nrg_over.png" alt="Nuclear Energy Overview"></p>

<p>At this point we've drilled down several categories, but have not yet reached any data.  The API browser conveniently provides us with another API call URL that will access the data on this page; but like the previous example, this would only give us the list of objects shown on this page.  However, each of these links is actual data.  How do I know that?  Because the bullet list is denoted "Child Series", whereas on previous pages we were looking at list of "Children Categories".  That is how you know whether you are looking at another sub-category or actual data.  So click the link to "Nuclear Share of Electricity Net Generation, Annual (Percent)" and you will be taken to the following page:</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_share.png" alt="Nuclear Energy Overview"></p>

<p>Excellent!  Exactly what we wanted.  We can see on this page a nice plot showing the percentage of U.S. electricity that came from nuclear power on an annual basis.  Now to get this data using the API, all we have to do is use the query string given to us on this page.  Let's modify our code and see if we can get a JSON object containing this data.  All we have to do is change our query variable, right?</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> query <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&amp;series_id=TOTAL.NUETSUS.A<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;</pre></div>

<p>Oops!  That didn't work.  Can you figure out why?  We have to change our URL as well since we are now querying a series instead of categories.  So let's create a new variable called <code>type</code> that we can change depending on which the kind of data we are requesting.  Here's what the entire request code looks like:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> req <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-k">new</span> <span class="pl-en">XMLHttpRequest</span>();
<span class="pl-k">var</span> url <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>http://api.eia.gov/<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> type <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>series/?<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> api_key <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>api_key=45AF218653356B8673FD6F039FC9AB94<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-k">var</span> query <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>&amp;series_id=TOTAL.NUETSUS.A<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>;
<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-c1">open</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>GET<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, url <span class="pl-k">+</span> type <span class="pl-k">+</span> api_key <span class="pl-k">+</span> query, <span class="pl-c1">true</span>);
<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-en">addEventListener</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>load<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>, <span class="pl-k">function</span>() {
    <span class="pl-k">var</span> response <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">JSON</span>.<span class="pl-c1">parse</span>(<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-smi">responseText</span>);
    <span class="pl-en">console</span>.<span class="pl-c1">log</span>(response);
});
<span class="pl-smi">req</span>.<span class="pl-c1">send</span>(<span class="pl-c1">null</span>);</pre></div>

<p>Examining the output in the console, we see that nested in the response object is an array of data containing the same values as shown on the API browser page.  </p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/nuke_share_output.png" alt="Nuclear Energy Overview"></p>

<p>There is an array of objects each containing a year and a percentage value (e.g. 2013 and 19.4).  The value is the percentage of electricity that came from nuclear power.</p>

<a id="embedding-a-visualization" class="anchor" href="#embedding-a-visualization" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Embedding a Visualization</h3>

<p>Now that you are able to access the data and have it in a nice JSON object, you can use it however you need in your application, website, whatever.  But, another really handy feature provided by the API is the ability to embed the visualization of this data directly into your own webpage.  On the API Browser page for this data set, click the link where it says "show me how to embed a chart of this series" (highlighted in screenshot below):</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/chart_embed.png" alt="Nuclear Energy Overview"></p>

<p>This takes you to the following page:</p>

<p><img src="https://timothythomas.github.io/images/html_embed.png" alt="Nuclear Energy Overview"></p>

<p>The EIA has really done a nice job of making it easy to embed visualizations of their data.  Simply copy the provided text directly into an html document and you can have your own webpage containing this visualization.  An the  tag in HTML simply links to another HTML document.  In this case, the EIA has done all the hard work of converting the data into an html visualization and we can simply add the widget to our webpage.  Here is some HTML code to demonstrate.  Simply copy this to a file and open it in a browser </p>
